{"name":"Bootstrap-outline-btn","tagline":"Styles for bootstrap buttons that are outlined. Also includes styles for inverses of the buttons.","body":"### Welcome to Bootstrap-outline-btn.\r\nThis might (actually its very likely) already be out in the world but I found myself copying my own code and going and finding stuff out on the internet. So I just threw the good stuff for this functionality into a file and I will keep it here. Its very simple here it is.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n.btn-outline {\r\n    color: inherit;\r\n    background-color: transparent;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.btn-primary.btn-outline {\r\n    color: #428bca;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Here are some examples of the buttons with the code as well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this style sheet? You can fix it if you would like, or create an issue and I will look at it. I think I will try and add to this eventually...Thanks!!!!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
